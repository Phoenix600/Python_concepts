# List is collection of ordered elements && All the elements in a list do not need to be of same type
# List is declared  by a = [1,1.2,'Hello Python Interpreter']
# This is how we declare the the empty string list_sample = [] 
# Python lists follows the indexing 0 to n-1 , where n is the number of elements in the list
# In List you can print elements selectively by setting the range of elements
# [0:3] the following will print elements from index 0 to 2 not 3, 3 is lower limit
# [5:]  the following will print elements from index 5 till the last element of list
# Normally to print all elements of list we use just put name of list in @print() function

# Creating sample list  : 

sample_list = ['Pranay Ramteke',17,'ETC','SBJAIN','PASS', 7.2 ,'Male']
# indexing            0          1   2      3        4     5     6
